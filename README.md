# SOLUTIONS ON PROGRAMMING PROBLEMS

# PROBLEM 1:
 - Given an string find the first character that has recurred and print it if none of the characters recurred then print message "No recurring character".
 
	Example:

		string = "ABCA"
		output: A
		
		string = "BAACB"
		output: B
		
		string = "ABC"
		output: No recurring character

# PROBLEM 2:
 - Given an array of integers [1,2,3] the array represents 123 the goal is to add 1 so that the output will become 124.
 
	Example:
	
		[1,2,3]
		output: 124
		
		[1,3,9]
		output: 140
		
		[9,9,9]
		output: 1000
    
  - Solution File Name: ArrayManipulation.java
  
  # PROBLEM 3:
 - Write an algorithm that will draw using any character relative to given parameters
 
	Example 1: 
	Given the following parameter: 3 
	Expected Result:	
	
		***
		***
		***
		
	Example 2: 
	Given the following parameter: 5,2 (where 5 is the width and 2 is the height) 
	Expected Result:	
		
		*****
		*****
		
	Example 3: 
	Given the following parameter: 5,3,2 (where 5 is the width and 3 is the height and 2 is the indent length) 
	Expected Result:	
		
		*****
		 *****
